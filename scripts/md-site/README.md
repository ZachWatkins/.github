# Markdown Website Generator

This module is used to generate a website from markdown files.

There are many options to do this with existing NPM packages and other tools. My reasons for building my own tool:

1. I can meet my own needs within 500 lines of code.
2. I would spend nearly as much time learning the existing tool(s) and implementing them as the time spent to create my own and give it simple implementation requirements.
3. The assurances and peace of mind gained from having my own tool outweighs the time and effort spent to create it.
