# .github

Repository of my shared GitHub integration files.

Although many of the files here are based on my own experience and scripts I've written for projects over the years, I drew a lot of inspiration and knowledge from the following repositories that are doing this at a level I can only describe as best in class:

1. [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs)
2. [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/.github)

Some GitHub actions were copied from these repositories as a starting point and if any attribution is warranted to them I do so freely.
