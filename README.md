## Use Cases

I have worked on a number of projects over the years, both personal and professional, and common tasks exist that can be automated using GitHub Actions.

The different ways in which I have worked (some more often than others) can be summed up as follows, in ascending order of complexity:

1. Personal private project
2. Personal public project
3. Personal public library
4. Collaborative project
6. Collaborative public library
8. Open source project
7. Open source library

## Terms

1. Personal - intended for my own use.
2. Collaborative - working with one or more people I know personally.
3. Open source - working in public and accepting public requests.
4. Project - codebase not intended for use within another codebase. Examples: website, theme, CLI-only program.
5. Library - codebase intended for use by other developers within their code.

## Inspiration

Although many of the files here are based on my own experience and scripts I've written for projects over the years, I drew a lot of inspiration and knowledge from the following repositories that are doing this at a level I can only describe as best in class:

1. [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs)
2. [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/.github)

Some GitHub actions were copied from these repositories as a starting point and if any attribution is warranted to them I do so freely.
